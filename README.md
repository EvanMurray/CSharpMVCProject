This is a website to play a simple RPG game. You as the player, must fight monsters until you either die or run away. 
There is a monster manager to add delete and edit your own monsters to fight. 

To get it up and running you have to run Update-Database in the Package Manager Console to get seed data for the website. 
Once the seed data has been generated the website should be good to go.
